    I am `alienteavend` Levente Nadai, semi-professional Overwatch coach, YouTube content creator, senior full-stack software engineer. In the past 10 years I have been teaching different things to different audiences, including college mathematics and programming,  project management, soft skill improvement and competitive esport gaming.

    I have been playing games from the age of 4 starting with old time DOS games (think of Prince of Persia, Wolfeinstein 3D and the like). After the spread of ADSL connections I started playing Call of Duty 1 competitively at the age of 13. Having a lot of free time allowed me to hone my skills as an FPS player and to start experiencing amateur esports, by getting into teams (they were called clans in COD). Fortunately my parents were tolerant of the teenager Me who spent most of his free time playing games with people from around the world who he mostly never met in real life. I was practicing daily for 3 to 4 hours, sometimes 8 to get to the top of my game and to be able to participate in high level tournaments. This is how my gamer career started, I was doing pretty well as a player. I stayed in the Call of Duty series, continuing with Call of Duty 2 where I was able to get into national and European high skill teams and then with Call of Duty 4 where we attended LAN parties and tournaments of different levels with great results, usually finishing in the top 4, earning fame and fortune. We were among the top ameteur competitors of ESL and Clanbase, and I also lead the 1v1 ladder of Clanbase for competitive Search and Destroy in Call of Duty 4 for 3 months. It was all a great experience and many of my former clanmates are still my friends today. All in all I have spent about 8000 hours playing Call of Duty games competitively, practicing mechanics, nade spots, participating in competitive matches and strategizing with my team. Those were the really good times! :)

    Apart from the Call of Duty series, I also have experience with Team Fortress 2 which we played casually with a team of friends and relatives for one year. We managed to secure first place in the Wireplay Tournament division 6 ofhello Europe, which was a nice accomplishment for a casual team only  playing for a few hours a day. I have spent around 1200 hours playing this game.

    I played other games as well, for example: League of Legends from the Beta and Starcraft 2 from release. I was able to get above the top 10th percentile in most of the competitive games I played with. I spent a lot of time playing MMORPG games like Lineage II and Guild of Wars 1 and 2, mostly for the social aspect.

    When Overwatch was released in 2016 One of my former teammates from the Call of Duty series invited me to play again competitively, and I took the opportunity. We managed to put together a team that became one of the best competitors in our nation meaning that we participated in LAN parties, tournaments and cups with great results. I currently play Overwatch in most of my gaming time, and have around 2500 hours of experience in scrims and ladder.

    I started the Overwatchdojo YouTube channel in late 2016 because there were no high quality educational videos for Overwatch at that time, and I took the opportunity to create something is visually satisfying and has applicable knowledge that the players can use right away in their next game. The channel was a great success in the beginning( given the fact that the team I worked with never did something like it) and it also got me into coaching, as few viewers of the channel ask for paid personal coaching. They wanted to purchase my knowledge which was awesome! I now have more than 400 hours of coaching experience with individuals and teams, coaching from really low level players to the top 0.5th percentile of the Overwatch competitive, from 10 years old to 72.
